<!-- 
    First start but pulling in the needed submodule : "git submodule update --init"
    Per readme, run autoreconf -fi to generate configure file 
    Also per readme, run ./configure --with-oniguruma=builtin --disable-maintainer-mode
    Finally run, make LDFLAGS=-all-static

    To do this with emscripten we prepend emconfigure and emmake on their lines respectively 

    Then mv jq jq.o to get the output of emmake into what emcc can ingest
